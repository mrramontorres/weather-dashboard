# Usage & Description
Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. A weather dashboard with form inputs provides a place to search for a city
in order to present  current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. The current city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index are presented to the user as well as the the 5-day forecast (displaying the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity). When a user selects the previous cities searched the dashboard is updated to reflect the city conditions.
